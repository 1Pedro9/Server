    <h2>Server Needs</h2>
    <p>
        What does the server need to be able to do for me in order 
        to replace either my online servers or any other servers 
        that I pay or potentially pay money for. For instance like 
        google drive. <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a href="">Drive</a>: It needs to be able to act as a 
                online drive which I can use to store my data. I want 
                to be able to backup my whole phone to it and I also 
                want to be able to store photos or games or software. 
                It needs to mimic: Google drive, One drive, iCloud 
                storage, Dropbox. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">Email</a>: Of course if it can handle the 
                drive then it should also be able to handle emails that 
                are being sent. It needs to be able to create and manage 
                email accounts and should also be able to receive and 
                send emails. It needs to also have a spam folder and 
                needs to be able to see certain emails and identify 
                it as spam. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">Messaging</a>: I want it to be able to act 
                as a messaging server in order to be able to have no 
                restrictions as to what is being sent. Also it will then 
                be end-to-end encrypted and no one would be able to see 
                your information. It is a replacement for WhatsApp.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">Web Hosting</a>: It needs to take over my web 
                server which I need to pay for each year. It needs to be 
                able to host websites and use git and be able to run 
                applications and all of the normal cpanel functionality. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">Database</a>: The server needs to be able to 
                run SQL databases without any restrictions. I need to be 
                able to access it from another device easily and also 
                write queries to it as the user that I am logged into. 
                Thus the server also needs to be able to handle users. 
                Different users all getting the server's resources
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">Software</a>: You need to be able to install 
                software and it needs to thus be able to also run it so 
                the user needs to have terminal access as well
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">Media Server</a>: The computer needs to be 
                able to stream movies, videos, music, etc. without needing 
                to check copyright. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">Security System</a>: Because the server will 
                be able to be accessed from outside the network. It needs 
                to be able to have a security camera system where it is 
                able to identify faces, fit them with known faces and 
                show what they are prone to do. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">Web Hosting</a>: For this section I want cyber 
                security tools to be pre installed for a user to be able 
                to use those tools from the server to run cyber security 
                functions
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        The server will be open source making it able for users from the outside to push updates and software to the server to use.
